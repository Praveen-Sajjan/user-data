# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I developed this using ReactJS by create-react-app.

Then I sorted the files(deleted few files which weren't necessary) in order to keep the clean code structure and file managing.

The way I planned and accomplished this assignment is simple.

At first, I created few files which were necessary in the src folder.

Then I carried out by creating a Navigation Bar.

The Navigation Bar consists of a button named Get User on the right hand side and a brand logo on the left hand side.

Then, I took a template of Fetch API from React and carried out creating a Fetch API call by adding the link provided, did a few trial and error and then got the output after encountering a few errors here and there.

For the grid layout, I have used Bootstrap which I felt as easy and also I have used it in my earlier projects too.

Coming to Animation part on the home page, I have taken it from one of the CodePen profiles and managed to edit it as per my requirements and added it into the code.

It's actually a bit complicated to code the whole animation part from scratch as it's a bit complicated, So, I have just taken it from the Internet and edited it in according to the project.

And the CSS I have used in this project is also simple and the coding part is all necessary one's and not so advanced level.

The whole UI idea is my own. The color palletes, the fonts and the design is done by me.

The time taken by me for completing this task is one and a half day.

I have started it on 24/03/2023 and completed it by 25/03/2023.



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
